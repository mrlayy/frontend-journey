## Today I Learned ðŸš€
### Absolute vs Relative Position in CSS

### ðŸ”‘ What I Learned
- **Relative Position**: Positioned relative to its normal position. Doesn't affect other elements.
- **Absolute Position**: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (not the viewport unless no ancestor is positioned).

### ðŸ§  Key Differences
| Property   | Relative                  | Absolute                 |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Position  | Relative to itself        | Relative to nearest positioned ancestor |
| Affects Layout | Yes                 | No                      |
| Use Case  | Nudging elements slightly | Precise positioning      |

### Example Code:
```css
.container {
  position: relative;
}
.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 10px;
}
```

### Reflection ðŸ’ª
Today I learned how positioning works in CSS and how absolute and relative properties can be combined to create dynamic layouts.
